      <p>While we all are in various dependencies on complex digital infrastructures, this fact remains either unconscious or difficult to understand for most people. This project is an invitation to engage with the fundamental conditions of digital infrastructure. By examining the relationship between a website, the server on which it is hosted, and the surrounding infrastructure, the abstract nature of the supposedly digital world is broken down and its physical realities are illuminated.

<br><br>To this end, a self-sufficient web server has been developed, based on a Raspberry Pi 4 and equipped with a battery HAT and an LTE module. This web server, which sometimes moves and sometimes stays still, serves as a host for a digital publication. This publication, in turn, turns the inside of the server outward by providing real-time information about the server. Thus, an interactive platform with various tools is created, allowing users to experiment.

Initially, basic parameters such as the type of connection, the type of power supply, the current charge level, and the current location of the server are visualized. This enables direct insight into the operating conditions of the server and makes the normally hidden aspects of digital infrastructure visible.

With a focus on the relationship between users and the path to the server, it creates an awareness of the physical dimension of digital communication.

Regarding the surrounding digital and physical infrastructure, a map offers the possibility to trace the route that the data has taken from the users to the server. This way, the server and users collectively map the digital infrastructure piece by piece. This collaborative mapping fosters a deeper understanding of the complexity and vastness of the network infrastructures that enable our digital communication.

Another tool allows the server to be restarted directly via the website. This process causes the server to be unreachable for a few seconds for other users as well. This makes the fragility and dependency of digital infrastructure tangible and invites reflection on the stability and availability of online services.

<br><br>Another component of the website is also a glossary that explains basic terms. This glossary is designed to provide access for users with different levels of knowledge and simultaneously offers starting points for further engagement. It serves as an educational resource that makes complex technical contexts understandable and contributes to emancipation in dealing with digital technologies.
